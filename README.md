# Disclaimer
Performance is shit =) 

I blame garbage collector for it. Probably will do profiling and optimization.

Port is not fully complete:
- PNG sprite loading not yet ported
- Texture pack support are not ported
- Here and there you may find a missing function
- All unnecessary UInts replased with Ints

But the core functionality is there.
